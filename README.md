# Picnic-Puzzles

*If you're here from MIT Admissions and you've recieved my puzzles, check out the "MIT Puzzles Additional Info, Hints, and Solutions" folder

These are picnic puzzles I design in my free time, inspired by the Akaki's picnic series. If you finish mine, go check out Akaki's puzzles.

I've designed more than what's on this github, but these my favorites that (in my opinion) have very satisfying solutions

From my experience printing these puzzles, I've made STLs with tolerances I've found work the best on different printers.  The "Extra loose" files are good for "thicker" filament, which I've found helpful for printing Translucent Amazon Basics PLA on my Ender 3 Pro.

All the prints on this github can be printed without supports (including the picnic basket).
