# Picnic-Puzzles
Picnic puzzles that I've designed, inspired by the Akaki's Picnic packing puzzle series

These are picnic puzzles I design in my free time. If you finish mine, go check out Akaki's picnic, with various other picnic packing puzzles.

From my experience printing these puzzles, I've made STLs with tolerances I've found work the best on different printers.  The "Extra loose" files are good for "thicker" filament, which I've found helpful for printing Translucent Amazon Basics PLA on my Ender 3 Pro.
