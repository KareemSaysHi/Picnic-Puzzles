Sneaky Basket: Here's the backstory...
You're going to the movies.  But there's no way you're gonna pay for the horrendously overpriced candy at the concessions stand!  You buy your candy from the Walmart nearby, and now you have to smuggle it in.  Mission: bring the candy in without getting caught, by hiding the candy under the water bottles in your picnic basket.

I recommend printing the water bottles and candy parts in different colors.
